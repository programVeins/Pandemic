The playground focuses on the COVID-19 Global pandemic that we face right now. While it might sound redundant at this point, people still are not following basic guidelines to counter the disease. This small playground is intended to educate these people on the basic Do's and Don'ts during these troubled times and warns them of the repercussions of careless actions.

Using UIImage views, I have built a choice-based game, wherein the user has to make choices about scenarios during the Covid-19 Pandemic. Wise choices lead to a wise ending. I have made use of royalty-free music provided by Looperman and copyright-free icons provided by Flaticon for this project. As the climax nears, we get a visual of how the virus has impacted the nation and the simulation ends on an optimistic and cheerful note.
